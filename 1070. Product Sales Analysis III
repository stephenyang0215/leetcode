Table: Sales

+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Product table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.
 

Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.
 

Write a solution to select the product id, year, quantity, and price for the first year of every product sold.

Return the resulting table in any order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT sf.product_id, sf.first_year, s.quantity, s.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN
(
    SELECT product_id, MIN(year) first_year
    FROM Sales
    Group By product_id
) sf
ON s.product_id = sf.product_id AND s.year = sf.first_year
