Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH TABLE_1 AS (
  SELECT "High Salary" AS CATEGORY UNION 
  SELECT "Low Salary"  AS CATEGORY UNION
  SELECT "Average Salary"  AS CATEGORY 
)
SELECT TABLE_1.CATEGORY, COUNT(TABLE_2.account_id) AS accounts_count
FROM TABLE_1 LEFT JOIN
(
SELECT *, CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN "Low Salary"
            WHEN 20000 <= income AND income <= 50000 THEN "Average Salary"
            WHEN income > 50000 THEN "High Salary" 
            END AS CATEGORY
       FROM Accounts) TABLE_2 ON TABLE_1.CATEGORY = TABLE_2.CATEGORY
GROUP BY TABLE_1.CATEGORY
